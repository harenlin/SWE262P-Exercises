## Language
#### Python3

## Exercise Spec
Using Python + numpy, or any other array programming language, 
implement a program that takes as input an array of characters 
(the characters from ```pride-and-prejudice```, for example), 
normalizes to UPPERCASE, 
ignores words smaller than 2 characters, 
and replaces the vowels with their [Leet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) counterparts when there is a one-to-one mapping. 
Then it prints out the 5 most frequently occurring 2-grams. 
(2-grams are all 2 consecutive words in a sequence) 
Note that you should stick to the array programming style as much as possible. 
This means: avoid explicit iteration over the elements of the array. 
If you find yourself writing an iteration, 
think of how you could do it with one or more array operations. 
(Sometimes, it's not possible; but most often it is)

## HOW TO RUN
Simply run the command on the terminal: ```python3 Three.py ./../pride-and-prejudice.txt```.
